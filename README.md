# Eurorack Generative

A framework for generative music, built on TidalCycles, that interfaces with my eurorack modular synthesizer. 

## Ideas
 - Use pyo python library to create lfos
 - Create small scripts that can generate 4 hour songs
 - Create dedicated functions for interacting with spitfire strings, spitfire pianos, etc
 - Send chords to novation peak, minilogue
 - Send bass or arps to mother-32
 - Use TidalCycles to generate stuff
 - Make it so TidalCycles can call python scripts for music generation
